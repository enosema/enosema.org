== Leading Standards Organizations and Companies Unite to Drive Open Metaverse Interoperability

June 21st, 2022 -- Announced today,
The https://metaverse-standards.org/[Metaverse Standards Forum] brings
together leading standards organizations and companies for industry-wide
cooperation on interoperability standards needed to build the open metaverse.
The Forum will explore where the lack of interoperability is holding back
metaverse deployment and how the work of Standards Developing Organizations
(SDOs) defining and evolving needed standards may be coordinated and
accelerated. Open to any organization at no cost, the Forum will focus on
pragmatic, action-based projects such as implementation prototyping, hackathons,
plugfests, and open-source tooling to accelerate the testing and adoption of
metaverse standards, while also developing consistent terminology and deployment
guidelines.

The metaverse is motivating the novel integration and deployment of diverse
technologies for collaborative spatial computing, such as interactive 3D
graphics, augmented and virtual reality, photorealistic content authoring,
geospatial systems, end-user content tooling, digital twins, real-time
collaboration, physical simulation, online economies, multi-user gaming, and
more -- at new levels of scale and immersiveness.

Multiple industry leaders have stated that the potential of the metaverse will
be best realized if it is built on a foundation of open standards. Building an
open and inclusive metaverse at pervasive scale will demand a constellation of
open interoperability standards created by SDOs such as The Khronos Group, the
World Wide Web Consortium, the Open Geospatial Consortium, the Open AR Cloud,
the Spatial Web Foundation, and many others. The Metaverse Standards Forum aims
to foster consensus-based cooperation between diverse SDOs and companies to
define and align requirements and priorities for metaverse
standards—accelerating their availability and reducing duplication of effort
across the industry.

"The metaverse will bring together diverse technologies, requiring a
constellation of interoperability standards, created and maintained by many
standards organizations," said Neil Trevett, Khronos president. "The Metaverse
Standards Forum is a unique venue for coordination between standards
organizations and industry, with a mission to foster the pragmatic and timely
standardization that will be essential to an open and inclusive metaverse."

Hosted by the Khronos Group, the Forum is open to any company, standards
organization, or university at no charge through a simple click-through
Participant Agreement. Companies that wish to provide Forum oversight, and may
wish to fund Forum projects, can choose to become a Principal member.

The activities of the Forum will be directed by the needs and interests of its
members and may involve diverse technology domains such as 3D assets and
rendering, human interface and interaction paradigms such as AR and VR, user
created content, avatars, identity management, privacy, and financial
transactions. Forum meetings are expected to start in July 2022. More
information on joining can be found at metaverse-standards.org.
